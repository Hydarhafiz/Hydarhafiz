## Past Projects

### **Prescriptive Analytics for Saline Aquifer Storage Detection**

#### **Introduction**
This project developed an AI-driven prescriptive analytics framework to identify optimal carbon capture and storage (CCS) locations in deep saline aquifers. The solution integrates modern AI/ML technologies to transform complex geological data into actionable insights for both technical and non-technical stakeholders, contributing to global climate change mitigation efforts.

#### **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend:** React + Vite, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
- **Databases:** Neo4j (Graph Database), PostgreSQL
- **AI/ML:** qwen2.5-coder:7b, llama3:8b, K-means Clustering, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- **Conatinerization:** Docker, Docker Compose

#### **Key Features**
- **Full-Stack AI/ML Application:** Designed and built an end-to-end system with a web-based chatbot interface and a robust Python backend.
- **Integrated LLM Framework:** Utilized qwen2.5-coder:7b to translate natural language queries into executable Neo4j database queries and llama3:8b to generate insightful, analytical responses.
- **Knowledge Graph and ML Engine:** Preprocessed over 100,000 geological records into a Neo4j knowledge graph. An ML-driven recommendation engine using K-means clustering was implemented, with SHAP values used to optimize parameters and enhance recommendations.
- **Containerized Deployment:** The entire application was containerized using Docker and Docker Compose, ensuring the system's portability, scalability, and ease of deployment.
- **User Validation:** The system's effectiveness was confirmed through User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with domain experts from Petronas Research Sdn Bhd (PRSB).
