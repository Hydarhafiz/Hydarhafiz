### About Me
A passionate and driven software developer with a strong focus on **AI/ML and full-stack development**. I specialize in building end-to-end applications that leverage the power of artificial intelligence to solve complex problems. My experience includes designing and implementing custom AI workflows, from integrating specialized **large language models (LLMs)** for code generation and analysis to developing **prescriptive analytics frameworks** using machine learning.

I am highly proficient with modern tech stacks, including **Python/FastAPI** for robust backends, **React/TypeScript** for dynamic frontends, and **PostgreSQL/Neo4j** for structured and graph databases. My work on projects like the "Vibe Coder AI Prototype" and the "Prescriptive Analytics for Saline Aquifer Storage Detection" demonstrates my ability to build scalable, containerized applications that deliver tangible value. I am adept at using tools like **Docker** and frameworks such as **Ollama** to create efficient, private, and high-performance systems. I am dedicated to continuous learning and applying cutting-edge technologies to create innovative solutions.

### ðŸ’» Past Projects

#### **Final Year Project: Prescriptive Analytics for Saline Aquifer Storage Detection (Private repo)**
*Jan 2025 - Aug 2025*
* **Introduction**: Developed a prescriptive analytics framework to identify optimal carbon capture and storage (CCS) locations in deep saline aquifers. The project integrated AI/ML to transform complex geological data into actionable insights, contributing to global climate change mitigation efforts.
* **Technologies**: **React** + **Vite**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, **FastAPI**, **Neo4j** (Graph Database), **PostgreSQL**, **qwen2.5-coder:7b**, **llama3:8b**, **K-means Clustering**, **SHAP**, **Docker**, **Docker Compose**.
* **Key Features**:
    * **Full-Stack AI/ML Application**: An end-to-end system with a chatbot interface and a robust Python backend.
    * **Integrated LLM Framework**: Used LLMs to translate natural language queries into executable database queries and to generate analytical responses.
    * **Knowledge Graph & ML Engine**: Preprocessed over 100,000 geological records into a Neo4j knowledge graph and implemented an ML-driven recommendation engine.
    * **Containerized Deployment**: Deployed the entire application using Docker for portability and scalability.
